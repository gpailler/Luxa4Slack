  LockedList plug-in 3.0.0.4 by Afrow UK

   An NSIS plug-in to display or get a list of 32-bit programs that are
   locking a selection of files that have to be uninstalled or
   overwritten.

   Last build: 19th April 2015

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

  ANSI NSIS build:
    Extract Plugins\LockedList.dll to your NSIS\Plugins folder.

  Unicode NSIS build:
    Extract Unicode\Plugins\LockedList.dll to your NSIS\Unicode\Plugins
    folder.

  See Examples\LockedList for an example of use.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 More information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The main plug-in functions loop through system handles and process
  modules to find a file that your installer has to overwrite or delete.

  As of v0.4, LockedList supports listing of currently open
  applications.

  As of v0.7, the plug-in also supports listing of applications from
  window classes and captions.

  As of v0.9, a Unicode build is included.

  As of v3.0.0.0, 64-bit module enumeration (for ::AddModule) is now
  supported. Simply extract a copy of LockedList64.dll to $PLUGINSDIR
  on 64-bit machines (see the LockedListKernel32.nsi example script).
  The same LockedList64.dll is used for both ANSI and Unicode
  installers.

  For the LockedList dialog, processes on the list will be removed when
  they have been closed or terminated, enabling the Next button if the
  list becomes empty.

  LockedList also has support for silent installers with NSIS stack
  interaction as opposed to using a dialog. Silent searching can also be
  performed asynchronously so that other tasks can be performed while
  the plug-in searches (such as a progress bar).

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Known issues/limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * The plug-in uses API's only available on Windows NT4 and upwards and
    therefore you cannot use the plug-in on a version of Windows that is
    older than Windows NT4.

    WinVer.nsh will help in this area...

    !include WinVer.nsh
    ...

      ${If} ${AtLeastWinNt4}
        ; Call LockedList plugin.
      ${EndIf}

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Adding paths of locked files or modules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  These functions must be called before displaying the dialog
  or performing a silent search.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

  LockedList::AddFile "path\to\myfile.ext"

  This adds an ordinary file. These files are searched for case
  insensitively by enumerating open file handles.

  String matching is done from the end of the string, therefore you can
  also specify just the file name (with a leading backstroke) like so:
    "\myfile.ext"

  See Examples\LockedList\LockedListTest.nsi for an example.

  LockedList::AddModule "path\to\mylibrary.dll"
  LockedList::AddModule "path\to\mycontrol.ocx"
  LockedList::AddModule "path\to\myapp.exe"

  This adds a module file. This includes DLLs, OCXs and EXEs. These
  files are searched for case insensitively by enumerating running
  process modules. To enumerate 64-bit DLLs and OCXs you must extract
  LockedList64.dll to $PLUGINSDIR first.

  String matching is done from the end of the string, therefore you can
  also specify just the file name (with a leading backstroke) like so:
    "\mylibrary.dll"

  See Examples\LockedList\LockedListShell32.nsi for an example.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

  LockedList::AddFolder "path\to\myfolder"

  This adds a folder, causing both files and modules to be enumerated.
  Please use carefully as this can result in many processes being found.

  See Examples\LockedList\LockedListFolder.nsi for a (bad) example

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

  LockedList::AddClass "class_with_wildcards"

  This adds an application by window class. You can use wildcards such
  as * and ? for searching.

  See Examples\LockedList\LockedListClass.nsi for an example.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

  LockedList::AddCaption "caption_with_wildcards"

  This adds an application by window caption/title. You can use
  wildcards such as * and ? for searching.

  See Examples\LockedList\LockedListCaption.nsi for an example.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

  LockedList::AddApplications

  Adds all applications currently running.

  See Examples\LockedList\LockedListApplications.nsi for an example.

  GetFunctionAddress $CallbackFunctionAddress AddCustomCallback
  LockedList::AddCustom [/icon "path\to\file.ext"] "application_name" \
                        "process_name" $CallbackFunctionAddress

  Adds a custom item to the list with a callback function. The callback
  function is used to check if the custom item should remain listed or
  not.

  /icon specifies the full path to an icon to use on the list. It can be
  an icon file (.ico) or resource (.exe, .dll).

  "application_name" is what will be displayed under the Application
  list box column for the custom item. "process_name" will be displayed
  under the Process column.

  $CallbackFunctionAddress is any variable containing the callback
  function's address, which is retreived by using GetFunctionAddress.

  The plug-in will Push "process_name" onto the stack before calling the
  callback function. The callback function must Push "true" if the
  custom item should remain listed or Push "false" otherwise. You can
  also use the LockedList::IsFileLocked function inside your callback
  which pushes the correct stack values.

  See Examples\LockedList\LockedListCustom.nsi for an example.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Displaying the search dialog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  LockedList::Dialog [optional_params]
   Pop $Var

  This is the normal way to display the dialog.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

  LockedList::InitDialog [optional_params]
   Pop $HWNDVar
  LockedList::Show
   Pop $Var

  This method allows you to modify controls on the dialog with
  SendMessage, SetCtlColors etc by using the $HWNDVar between
  the InitDialog and Show calls and also in the page's leave
  function.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

  At this point, $Var will contain "error" on display error,
  "next" if the next button was pressed,
  "back" if the back button was pressed or
  "cancel" if the cancel button was pressed.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

  These [optional_params] apply to both LockedList::Dialog and
  LockedList::InitDialog. The parameter names are case insensitive.

  /heading    "text"  - Set page heading text.

  /caption    "text"  - Set dialog caption text.

  /colheadings        - Set the column heading texts in the processes
   "application_text"   list. An empty string `` will use the default
   "process_text"       text.

  /noprograms "text"  - Item text when no programs to be closed are
                        running.

  /searching  "text"  - Item text while searching is in progress.

  /endsearch  "text"  - Item text when user clicks back or cancel
                        during a search.

  /endmonitor "text"  - Item text when user clicks back or cancel after
                        a search (at which point the list of programs is
                        being monitored for closing).

  /usericons          - Program will use icons "search.ico" and
                        "info.ico" in the current working directory
                        instead of using icons from shell32.dll for the
                        searching list. If no icons are found, the
                        installer icon is used.

  /ignore             - Allow the user to click Next even if there are
   "next_button_text"   items on the list. "next_button_text" sets the
                        Next button text. Use "" to use the default
                        Next button text. This parameter is ignored if
                        /autoclose or /autoclosesilent is used.

  /autoclose          - Close all running processes on exit with the
   "close_text"         confirmation message box "close_text".
   "kill_text"          Processes that cannot be closed safely with
   "failed_text"        WM_CLOSE are killed with the confirmation
   "next_button_text"   message box "kill_text". If processes are still
                        running then the "failed_text" message box is
                        displayed. An empty string "" will use the
                        default text. "next_button_text" sets the Next
                        button text. Use "" to use the default Next
                        button text.

  /autoclosesilent    - Same as the above switch except the close and
   "failed_text"        kill confirmation boxes are not displayed. If
   "next_button_text"   some processes cannot be killed, the
                        "failed_text" message is still displayed and the
                        user is prevented from continuing with setup. An
                        empty string "" will use the default text.
                        "next_button_text" sets the Nextbutton text. Use
                        "" to use the default Next button text.

  /menuitems          - Sets the list context menu item texts.
   "close_text"
   "copy_list_text"

  /autonext           - Moves to the next page automatically if no
                        processes are found.

  Examples:

  LockedList::Dialog /caption `I like cheese` /heading `I do really`
   Pop $Var

  LockedList::Dialog /autoclose `` `` `Couldn't kill 'em all, oops!`
   Pop $Var

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Searching silently
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  GetFunctionAddress $AddrVar SilentSearchCallback
  LockedList::SilentSearch [/async] $AddrVar
   Pop $Var

  Begins the search silently using the given callback function. Specify
  /async to allow the search to commence asynchronously. You can then
  check the progress of the asynchronous search with the SilentWait and
  SilentPercentComplete functions listed below.

  $Var will contain "ok" if /async was used and the search started
  successfully. If not using /async, $Var will contain "done" on search
  completion or "cancel" on search cancellation.

  The callback function is given 3 stack items:
    Process id, full path, description.

  The callback function must push "true" to continue enumeration or
  "false" to cancel the search. Pushing "autoclose" will close the
  current process before continuing the search.

  An example:
    Function SilentSearchCallback
      Pop $R0 ; process id
      Pop $R1 ; file path
      Pop $R2 ; description
      ; do stuff here
      Push true ; continue enumeration
    FunctionEnd

  Note: If "autoclose" was pushed and the auto-close failed, the
  callback function will be called again with a process id of "-1". This
  can be used to display a message to the user, if required.

  See Examples\LockedList\LockedListTest.nsi for a full example.
  See Examples\LockedList\LockedListAutoCloseSilent.nsi for an 
  auto-close example.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Searching silently asynchronously
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  These can only be used after calling SilentSearch with /async (see
  above).

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

  LockedList::SilentWait [/time #]
   Pop $Var

  If SilentSearch /async was used, this function will wait until the
  thread has finished, or optionally, return in # milliseconds when
  using /time #.

  $Var will contain either "wait" or "done" depending on whether or not
  the searching has finished. If the search was cancelled (by pushing
  "false" in the callback function), $Var will be "cancel".

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

  LockedList::SilentPercentComplete
   Pop $Var

  $Var will contain the current completion percentage, i.e. 65 for 65%.
  This can be used in a progress message.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Other functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  LockedList::IsFileLocked "file_path"
   Pop $Var

  At this point, $Var is "true" or "false". This function can be used in
  the AddCustom callback function for example.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

  GetFunctionAddress $AddrVar EnumProcessesCallback
  LockedList::EnumProcesses $AddrVar
   Pop $Var

  Enumerates all running processes using a callback function.

  The callback function is given 3 stack items:
    Process id, full path, description.

  The callback function must push "true" to continue enumeration or
  "false" to cancel enumeration. $Var will contain "done" on search
  completion or "cancel" on search cancellation.

  See Examples\LockedList\LockedListEnumProcesses.nsi for an example.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

  LockedList::FindProcess [/yesno] process.exe
   Pop $Var
   [Pop $Var2
    Pop $Var3]

  Finds a process by executable name (you must include the .exe). If you
  specify /yesno then the function will push "yes" or "no" onto the
  stack. Otherwise, by default, the function will place an empty string
  on the stack if no processes are found, or 3 stack items otherwise:
    Process id, full path, description.

  See Examples\LockedList\LockedListFindProcess.nsi for an example.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

  LockedList::CloseProcess [/kill] process.exe
   Pop $Var

  Closes a process by executable name (you must include the .exe) by
  sending WM_CLOSE to the application main window. Specify /kill to
  terminate the process forcefully instead.

  See Examples\LockedList\LockedListCloseProcess.nsi for an example.
